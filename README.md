This repository contains the source code of our prototype that addresses the problem statement we have chosen
Note to users and reviewers:
The UI developed and generated through this source code is the most basic version of the UI that facilitates text inputs from users.
There is scope of development for our UI with the aid of paid and distrutable licensed API's and sensors(ex. Smappee API and sensors) provided by startups.
The sample data used to visualise ESG reports has been extracted from the yfinance library of Python.

Future versions/Scope of our UI would include:

1. Extracting data from sensors and using a DBMS system to store the same.
2. Data visualisation through Smappee's API.
3. Improving the advising system to make it more automated and accurate through a predictive and self-learning AI model.
